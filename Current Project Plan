## Current Project Plan:

Reminders:

-Version Control: Use Git to track changes and collaborate.
-Documentation: Maintain detailed notes on methodologies, assumptions, and findings.

Tools & Libraries:

-Python: Make sure you have the following installed:
-Pandas: For data manipulation.
-NumPy: For numerical operations.
-Beautiful Soup: For web scraping.
-Matplotlib: For data visualization.
-Seaborn: For statistical graphics.
-Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
-SciPy: For statistical analysis.
-Statsmodels: For econometric models.
-Jupyter Notebook: Useful for iterative development. (Look up how to install and use it if not already set up.)

Steps & Tasks:

1. Verify Python Environment
Task 1.1: Open Visual Studio Code and check if Pandas, NumPy, and Beautiful Soup are installed.
Use pip list in the terminal.
Task 1.2: If any libraries are missing or outdated, run:
pip install pandas numpy beautifulsoup4
Task 1.3: Install Jupyter Notebook if not already set up:
pip install notebook
Task 1.4: Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new notebook to test library functionality.

2. Data Sources
Task 2.1: Review the structure of the VoteHub Polls site for data extraction.
Task 2.2: Write a Python script using Beautiful Soup to scrape the relevant polling data from VoteHub.
Task 2.3: Test the web scraper to ensure it retrieves the correct data.

3. Compile Data
Task 3.1: Load both CSV files (538 and VoteHub) into separate DataFrames using Pandas.
Task 3.2: Merge the two DataFrames into a single DataFrame, ensuring consistency in column names.
Task 3.3: Save the combined DataFrame as a new CSV file for future reference.

4. Load and Clean Data
Task 4.1: Load the combined CSV into a new DataFrame.
Task 4.2: Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data (e.g., filling in missing values or correcting formats).
Task 4.3: Organize the DataFrame by:
Task 4.3.1: State
Task 4.3.2: Party affiliation
Task 4.3.3: Type of polls
Task 4.3.4: Sample size
Task 4.3.5: Demographics

5. Automate State Identification
Task 5.1: Identify patterns in the existing data that can be used to classify states.
Task 5.2: Write a function to automate state identification based on these patterns.
Task 5.3: Test the function on a subset of your data to validate its accuracy.

6. Set Up Pollster Sheets
Task 6.1: Create a new Excel or CSV template for each pollster data sheet.
Task 6.2: Define the structure of each sheet, including relevant columns (e.g., pollster name, state, party affiliation).
Task 6.3: Populate the templates with initial data for visualization.

7. Explore Methodology
Task 7.1: Research various polling methodologies and their advantages/disadvantages.
Task 7.2: Document findings in a structured format (e.g., Markdown or Word document).
Task 7.3: Compare methodologies and select the ones that best suit your analysis.

8. Build Your Models
Task 8.1: Define key metrics for analysis (e.g., average approval ratings, confidence intervals).
Task 8.2: Choose appropriate statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis, hypothesis testing).
Task 8.3: Create baseline models to analyze the initial polling data.
Task 8.4: Implement advanced models as you gather more insights (e.g., using machine learning techniques if applicable).
Task 8.5: Analyze the output from your models and document findings.
Task 8.6: Refine models based on feedback and new data.

9. Compare Methodology and Models
Task 9.1: Identify established methodologies and models used in polling analysis.
Task 9.2: Document how your approach differs or aligns with these methodologies.
Task 9.3: Collect feedback from peers or experts to assess the effectiveness of your models.

10. Develop a Comprehensive Reporting Framework
Task 10.1: Define key sections for the report (e.g., Introduction, Methodology, Findings, Conclusion).
Task 10.2: Create templates for consistent reporting.

11. Implement Continuous Learning and Feedback Loop
Task 11.1: Schedule regular reviews of models and methodologies.
Task 11.2: Establish a system for incorporating feedback from peers or experts into your analysis.

12. Ensure Compliance with Ethical Standards
Task 12.1: Research ethical considerations in polling data usage and reporting.
Task 12.2: Document your compliance strategies.

13. Build a User-Friendly Interface (Optional)
Task 13.1: Consider using a web framework (like Flask or Django) to present your findings interactively.
Task 13.2: Create input fields for users to explore data based on their interests.
