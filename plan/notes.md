Task 2.1: Review the Structure of the VoteHub Polls Site
Open a web browser and navigate to the VoteHub Polls site.
Examine the structure of the webpage. Look for the relevant data points you want to extract, such as polling results, dates, and candidate names.
Take notes on the HTML structure (tags, classes, or IDs) of the elements you want to scrape.
Task 2.2: Write a Python Script Using Beautiful Soup
In your Jupyter Notebook, create a new cell and start by importing the necessary libraries:
python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
Write a function to scrape the data:
python
Copy code
def scrape_votehub():
    url = "URL_OF_VOTEHUB_PAGE"  # Replace with the actual URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Example: Extracting polling data (adjust selectors based on the structure)
    polls_data = []
    for poll in soup.select('SELECTOR_FOR_POLL'):  # Adjust the selector
        # Extract relevant information, e.g., poll title, date, results
        title = poll.select_one('SELECTOR_FOR_TITLE').text.strip()
        date = poll.select_one('SELECTOR_FOR_DATE').text.strip()
        result = poll.select_one('SELECTOR_FOR_RESULT').text.strip()
        polls_data.append({'Title': title, 'Date': date, 'Result': result})
    
    return pd.DataFrame(polls_data)
Task 2.3: Test the Web Scraper
Call the function and display the DataFrame:
python
Copy code
votehub_data = scrape_votehub()
print(votehub_data.head())  # Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
Run the cell and check if the data is being extracted correctly. Adjust the selectors if necessary.
